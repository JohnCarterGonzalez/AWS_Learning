AWS EFS 
  Elastic File System 
    - managed network file system that can e mounted on many EC2 instances 
    - EFS works w/EC2 instances in mutiple AZs 
    - highly scalable, expensive, available, pay per use 
    - use cases: 
        content management
        web serving 
        data sharing 
        WordPress 
    - uses NFSv2.1 protocal (look that up)
    - uses secutrit groups to control access to EFS 
    - compatible with Linux based AMI (not windows)
    - encryption at rest using KMS
    - POSIX file system (~Linux) that has standard file API
    - file system scales automatically
    - performance:
        EFS scale: 
            1000s of concurrent NFS CLients, 10 Gib+ /s throughput
            grow to petabyte-scale network file system automatically
        Performance Mode: 
            gen purpose, latency sensitive use cases (web servers, CMS)
            Max I/Os - higher latency, throughput, highly parallel (big data pricessing)
        Throughput Mode: 
            Bursting ( 1 TB = 50 MiB/s + burst of up to 100 MiB/s )
            Provisioned: set your throughput regardless of storage size 
    - Storage Classes: 
        Storage Tiers (lifecycle management feature)
            Standard: for frequently accessed files
            Infrequent: access (EFS-IA): cost to retireve files, lower price to 
                        store, enable EFS-IA w/ a lifecycle policy
        Availability & Durablilty
            Standard: Multi AZ, great for production
            One Zone: great for dev, backup enabled by default, compatible w/IA
                      (EFS One Zone-IA) => 90% cost savings
