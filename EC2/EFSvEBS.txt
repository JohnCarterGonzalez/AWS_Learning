EBS V EFS
  EBS Volumes
    - EBS, can be attached to only one instance at a time 
    - are locked at the AZ level 
    - gp2: IO increases if the disk size increases 
    - io1: can increase IO independently
  EBS Migration
    - take a snapshot 
    - resote the snapshot to another AZ
    - EBS backups use IO and you shouldnt run them while your app is handling 
      heavy traffic 
  Root EBS Volumes of instances get terminated by defualt, if the EC2 is terminated
  (can be disabled)

  EFS
    - mounting 100s of instances across AZ
    - EFS share websites files 
    - only for linux instances (POSIX file system)
    - EFS has a higher cost 
    - can leverage EFS-IA for cost savings
